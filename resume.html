<hr>
 <p>A natural redhead, Mera grew up in Germany, starring in her first lead role in a ballet production at the age of 9. She went on to enjoy her acting debut on the professional stage when she was 10 and received her first award for best actress at 12 years old. Shortly thereafter she went to boarding school to train professionally in ballet. However, still wanting to act, she eventually started regularly sneaking out of boarding school to go to acting class as well as taking summer courses at drama school. Finishing school top of her class and a year early, she moved to England to pursue a career as an actress. She trained in Stratford-upon-Avon, home of the Royal Shakespeare Company and working i.a. with John Nolan, and then went on to savor Oxford University's drama scene while reading for a BA in Psychology & Philosophy. By the time she was 21 she had received 4 scholarships and lived in 10 different cities. She currently splits her time between London and LA. Other than acting, Mera loves being in the water and is a confident diver, as well as venturing deep into the colorful worlds of books, movies and the mind. She is also a certified energy healer.</p>
